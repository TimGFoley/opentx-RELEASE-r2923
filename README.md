opentx-RELEASE-r2923
====================

Branch for patching release version 2923 of OpenTx

- This branch adds RPM Gear Ratio options to the release version of OpenTx v2923.


Note that compiling any of the branches in this repository is at your own risk.   Make sure you understand what is being changed before running.  In many cases the eeprom file will not longer be compatible with the stock version so make sure you have backups BEFORE testing and before upgrading to a newer release by the devs.

Also being a custom mod, do not report issues related to this mod in the main developement tree, keep them local to here.  They have enough work to do without confusing things.

As new versions are released I'll patch as required and create a new branch with the mod.
