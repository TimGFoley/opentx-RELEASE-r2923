opentx-RELEASE-r2923
====================

Master for patching release version 2923 of OpenTx

This will serve as a base for adding custom patches to the release version that the core developers of OpenTx do not wish to implement in the core version they maintain and to allow users to work with a known good release and only small patches.

The development version (aka Next) is too unstable for daily user use.

Note that compiling any of the branches in this repository is at your own risk.   Make sure you understand what is being changed before running.  In many cases the eeprom file will not longer be compatible with the stock version so make sure you have backups BEFORE testing and before upgrading to a newer release by the devs.
